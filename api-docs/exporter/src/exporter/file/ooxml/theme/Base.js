 * The theme is the root-level complex type associated with a shared-style sheet.
 * This complex type holds all of the different formatting options available to a
 * theme, and defines the overall look and feel of a document when themed objects
 * are used within the document.
 *
 * A theme consists of four main parts, although the themeElements element is the
 * piece that holds the main formatting defined within the theme. The other parts
 * provide overrides, defaults, and additions to the information contained in
 * themeElements.

1) field regex validation is not working: If you define following textfield and error is appearing upon input change
	(Uncaught TypeError: regex.test is not a function).

	Please check -> ./src/components/form/Form.js:44

		<ExtTextfield
		  fieldLabel = 'Phone Number'
		  name = 'phone'
		  allowBlank = {false}
		  regex = {/^[\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]?[0-9]{4,6}$/im}
		/>

2) (Critical) Column functions like: renderer, getClass, isActionDisabled, are being called several times upon state
	change (This is only happening in classic, and should not happen based on: https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html &
	https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#react-only-updates-whats-necessary) In order to test this, you need
	to run the app -> npm start, a grid will appear, there is an action column with an envelope icon, please open the browser console
	and then click on the icon a window should appear, you will see that the render method is being called 12 times and
	there are only 3 records (look for the log -> Method renderSign has been called) and if you clean the console logs
	and then close the window, the render method is being called 24 times. This is causing big slowness in more complex
	views, we have a use case in which we have a view with a tab panel that have at least 8 grids and each grid have at least 8 columns
	and each grid have at least 4 renderers. Note: the render method should not be called, and this does not happen in modern

3) Browser is refreshing before the watch is finished (only happening in classic): In order to test this you need to start
	the app, and then uncomment line. ./src/components/grid/Grid.js:105. You will see that the sencha app compile process start,
	then it refresh the browser, but in the browser app wont render and following error appear:

	Ext.require is not a function
      at Module../App.js (App.js:7)
      at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:726)
      at fn (bootstrap:100)
      at Module../index.js (index.js:1)
      at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:726)
      at fn (bootstrap:100)
      at Object.0 (main.js?3de525dfb512234a75ae:114237)
      at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:726)
      at bootstrap:793
      at bootstrap:793

4) Toolbar Dock top or button is not working: Please look for the Toolbar definition at: ./src/components/grid/Grid.js:116
	and uncomment those lines. we want to have a top toolbar inside a grid without having unnesesary nesting. We know that we have have a wrapper panel for
	the grid and add the toolbar (it is working fine). Just run the app and you will see the result.

5) Panel Split property not working: Please look for Panel definition at: ./src/components/grid/Grid.js:127. We have defined a panel
	with the split property, but the splitter is not showing in the UI

6) Window listeners are not getting fired: Please look at ./src/components/window/Window.js:53 we are trying to log in
	console the show, boxready, afterrender events and we have tried different ways and none one is working. Question - are all the events
	of the components supported? is there any doc for ext react classic? Note - this is working in Modern

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) TextField onFocus and onBlur event is being fired twice: Please look for the
form.js - blur and focus called twice

8) tooltips on grid rows using a render and metadata
